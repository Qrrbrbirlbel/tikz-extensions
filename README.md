## Introduction

This is not a LaTeX package but a collection of libraries for PGF and TikZ.

These are

 * `transformations.mirror`,
 * `paths.arcto`,
 * `paths.ortho`,
 * `paths.timer`,
 * `patterns.images`,
 * `topaths.arcthrough` and
 * `misc`.

 These were developed in response to questions on tex.stackexchange.com.
 Some of these can be find by searching for my [user id](https://tex.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A16595+%22my+library%22).
