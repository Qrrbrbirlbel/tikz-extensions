\section{Usage}
This package is called |tikz-ext|, however, one can't load it via |\usepackage|.
Instead, this package consists of multiple PGF and \tikzname\space libraries
which are loaded by either |\usepgflibrary| or |\usetikzlibrary|.

\section{Why do we need it?}
Since I have been answering questions on \hyperlink{https://tex.stackexchange.com}{TeX.sx}
I've noticed that some questions come up again and again,
every time with a slightly different approach on how to solve them.

I don't like reinventing the wheel which is why I've gathered the code of my answers in this package.

And, yes, I am using them myself, too.

\section{Should these libraries be part of \tikzname?}
I guess.
