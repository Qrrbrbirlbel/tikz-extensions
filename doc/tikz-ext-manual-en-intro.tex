\part{Introduction}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\section{Usage}
This package is called |tikz-ext|, however,
one can't load it via |\usepackage|.%
\footnote{Except for \texttt{calendar-ext} and \texttt{pgffor-ext}.}
Instead, this package consists mostly of
\pgfname\space and \tikzname\space libraries
which are loaded by either |\usepgflibrary| or |\usetikzlibrary|.

\section{Why do we need it?}
Since I have been answering questions on
\hyperlink{https://tex.stackexchange.com}{TeX.sx}
I've noticed that some questions come up again and again,
every time with a slightly different approach on how to solve them.

I don't like reinventing the wheel which is why I've gathered
the solutions of my answers in this package.

\section{Having problems?}
Note however, that most of these extensions haven't been
stress-tested properly and might be considered
experimental.

Don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub.
You probably found a bug.
