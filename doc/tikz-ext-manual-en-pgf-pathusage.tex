\section{Path Usages}
\label{pgflibrary:pathusage}
\begin{purepgflibrary}{ext.pathusage}
  This library adds two stroke mechanism to \pgfname.
\end{purepgflibrary}

The stroke mechanisms are
\begin{itemize}
\item \declare{|unstroke|}/\declare{|undraw|} will \emph{not} stroke the path
      but will simulate it. This can be used so that the path's
      bounding box includes the line width that is added by \pgfname\ 
      on all four sides.
\item \declare{|stroke unstroke|}/\declare{|draw undraw|} will stroke the path
      but will \emph{not} increase the bounding box to include the line width.
\end{itemize}
