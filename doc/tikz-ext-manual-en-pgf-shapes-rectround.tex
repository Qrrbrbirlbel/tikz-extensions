\section{Shape: Rectangle with Rounded Corners}
\begin{pgflibrary}{ext.shapes.rectangleroundedcorners}
  A rectangle with rounded corners.
\end{pgflibrary}

\begin{shape}{rectangle with rounded corners}
This library provides a |rectangle with rounded corners| where every corner can have a different radius.

\begin{key}{/pgf/rectangle with rounded corners north west radius=\meta{dimen} (initially .5\string\pgflinewidth)}
  Sets the north west radius to \meta{dimen}.
\end{key}
\begin{key}{/pgf/rectangle with rounded corners north east radius=\meta{dimen} (initially .5\string\pgflinewidth)}
  Sets the north east radius to \meta{dimen}.
\end{key}
\begin{key}{/pgf/rectangle with rounded corners south west radius=\meta{dimen} (initially .5\string\pgflinewidth)}
  Sets the south west radius to \meta{dimen}.
\end{key}
\begin{key}{/pgf/rectangle with rounded corners south east radius=\meta{dimen} (initially .5\string\pgflinewidth)}
  Sets the south east radius to \meta{dimen}.
\end{key}
\begin{key}{/pgf/rectangle with rounded corners radius=\meta{dimen}}
  Sets all radii to \meta{dimen}.
\end{key}
